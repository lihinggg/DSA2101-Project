# Welcome to my DSA2101 Project where my group answered the question "What makes people want to climb a mountain"
The project utilised The Himalayan Database and used R language for coding. The group comprised of 4 students, myself included.

## Our project approached the question with 3 hypotheses:
- Certain countries are more likely to organise successful expeditions
- Taller Mountains may prove to be more enticing to climb
- Particular seasons may be beneficial for mountain hikes across differing regions

## Packages used include:
- maps
- readr
- stringr
- ggrepel
- ggridges
- tidyverse

## Key insights
- Nepal and USA hosted a significant number of successful expeditions
- Increasing relationship between the height of and number of expeditions on a mountain
- Prime seasons are Spring and Fall.
